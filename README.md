# Provident Form Test

## Notes

> So I found jsfiddle quite limiting and difficult to test responsiveness. Additionally I noticed my js code was not functioning on the platform but when brought in locally, it worked well. I completed a form that includes validation on jsfiddle but decided to do even more with the remaining time so I put this together for your review.

> For the most part I tried to mimic your current site per your instructions but I made some changes in respect to the validation functionality. Having in-line and directed error messages seems like a better user experience to me.

> This was a great excersise. I hope my work shows just how committed and able I am to work with you all. Thanks for looking!

## Future additions

With more time I would test responsiveness a bit more thoroughly. Also, I noticed your site has vastly different HTML layout. I touched on some of these changes by switching from desktop to mobile class but I would like to build out a separate HTML file for mobile in order to keep things organized. This also includes segmenting the CSS file as more is added.
